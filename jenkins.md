### JENKINS PIPELINES
---------------------------------------
A Jenkinsfile can be written using two types of syntax - Declarative and Scripted.
In jenkins console we can write a pipeline as well without use of vscode.
So in the jenkins console we also have types of pipelines
  
  * FREESTYLE PROJECT
     
     *A type of project that allows you to build, test, and deploy software using a variety of different options and configurations
  
  * PIPELINE
     
     * A suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
  
  * MULTI-CONFIGURATION PROJECT
     
     * we can create only one job with many configurations. Each configuration will be executed as a separate job. This is exactly what we need to simplify our scheduled tests, which can be used in conjunction with TestComplete or TestExecute. 
  
  * FOLDER
     
     * This plugin allows users to create "folders" to organize jobs.   

  * MULTIBRANCH PIPELINE
     
     * A multi-branch pipeline is a concept of automatically creating Jenkins pipelines based on Git branches. It can automatically discover new branches in the source control (Github) and automatically create a pipeline for that branch.
 
  * ORGANIZATION FOLDER
     
     *Organization Folders enable Jenkins to monitor an entire GitHub Organization, Bitbucket Team/Project, GitLab organization, or Gitea organization and automatically create new Multibranch Pipelines for repositories which contain branches and pull requests containing a Jenkinsfile .


### Jenkins Declarative Pipeline
---------------------------------------
1. Declarative Pipeline presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems.
2. The basic statements and expressions which are valid in Declarative Pipeline follow the same rules as Groovyâ€™s syntax with the following exceptions:
3. ![pre](basic%20structure%20of%20pipeline.png)
4. So we will be creating our pipeline through following this method.
5. Now lets create a pipeline for "game of life". Pipeline should be written by the help of jenkins pipeline steps 
6. ![refer here]https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent
7. So here we have written a declarative pipelie of game of life in that we made some mistakes so please check the previous commits also 
8. ![refer here]https://github.com/NADEEMSHAI/Jenkins/blame/main/Jenkinsfile
9. Here the process of pipeline written
     
     * I had forked the gameoflife into my gitrepo.
     * Next i need to specify the agent in that labels to determine that jenkinsfile will run on that node only.
     * After i used trigger to tell that when should it run.
     * Parametes is a job what i want jenkins to do with the code.
     * So i have to give needed tools to run this code.
     * So there are other which you can define here i need that it so ill go with stages in that stage in that steps.
     * Steps is the real job were work we will done before that it just a infra.
     * So i given the git link in https to code get clone and if you have rather than master branch you need to specify that branch also like main,dev,test.
     * So after code get clone i have to write a next stage to determine that what should do with that code.
     * I need to do mvn package. So the work was done 
     * ![pre](j1.png)
  
10. So above steps i have just done mvn package after that i need to do the package in to artifacts.
11. ![refer here]https://github.com/NADEEMSHAI/Jenkins/commit/f063d415aef40c33f0a7f3bd8f71f2a0921070ee
12. So here i had build the artifacts and also junit test. Here also i have made more commits please the all commit and changes 
13. ![pre](j3.png)
14. So here you can see the artifacts build sucessfully.
